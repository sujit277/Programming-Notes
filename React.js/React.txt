  What do you mean by React?
->React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook).
  It is used to develop single page Applications.

  What do you mean by JSX?
->JSX Stands for JavaSrcipt XML. JSX Allows us to write HTML in React.

  What are Components in React?
->Components are Independent and resuable bit of codes.They serve the same work
  Like JavaScript function does.

  What do you mean by Class Component in React?
->These components are made of simple classes that add functionality to the application.
  A class component requires us to extend from React.Component and create a render function
  which returns a React element.

  What do you mean by Functional Component in React?
->A React functional component is a simple JavaScript function that accepts props and returns
  a React element.
  
  What are the differences between react Class Components and function Components?
->      Class Components               |             Function Componentss  
  1.These Components are made up of      1. These are Component are like simple JavaScript 
    simple classes.                         function that accepts props and return React elements.

  2.There is a render method in class    2.There is no any render method in function component.
    component which returns react
    element.  

  3.Constructors are used.               3.Constructors are not used.

  What is State in React?
->The state is an object where we store property values that belongs to the component. 

  What do you mean by Props?
->Props are like functional arguments that are passed to the components as Attributes.

  What are the diffrence between state and Props in React?
->     Props                              |                   State  
   1.Data Passed from one component          1.Data passed within the component only.
     to other component.

   2.It is immutable.                        2.It is mutable.

   3.Props are readonly.                     3.State is both read and write.

   4.Props can be used with both class       4.State can only be used with class component
     and functional component.                 and functional component.     

  What is defaultProps in React ?
->The defaultProps is a React component property that allows us to set default values for the
  props argument. 

  What is PropTypes in React ?
->PropTypes are a way to validate the values types that are passed to the component as props.

  Why we specify Key during passing Attributes for Props?
->Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted.

  What are the different LifeCycles Methods of React Class components?
->These following are the different Life Cycle Methods of class Component --

  1.ComponentWillMount -- This Function is called before the Component is rendered into DOM.
  2.ComponenDidMount -- This function is called after the Component is renderd into DOM.
  3.ComponentWillUpdate -- This function is invoked before the Component Updation occurs.
  4.ComponentDidUpdate -- This function is called after the Component is Updated.
  5.ComponentWillUnMount -- This function is called before the component is removed or 
    Destroyed Permanently.

  What do you mean by hooks in react?
->Hooks are the concepts were added in the react 16.8 version.
  Hooks makes react better Because we have simpler code that implements similar functionality
  like class components faster and more effectively.

  What are the differnet types of hooks in React?
-> The Different types of Hooks in React -
    1. useEffect
    2. useState
    3. useContext
    4. useReducer
    5. useMemo
    6. useRef

    What do you mean useState ?
->  UseState is a Hook that allows us to have state variables in functional components.
    The React useState Hook allows us to keep track of state variable in a function component.
       
    Why we extends our class from React.Component in creating React Class Component?
->  The component has to include the extends React.Component statement, this statement 
    creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to 
    React.Component's functions.

12. Why we use render Method inside class Component ?
    React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called render(). The purpose of the 
    function is to display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element. In the
    render() method, we can read props and state and return our JSX code to the root component
    of our app.

    What do you mean by UseEffect in React?
->  useEffect tells our component What needs to be done after Component rendering and Component 
    Upation.
    useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)

    What do you mean by createContext in React?
->  createContext is used to create common data that have access throughout the component 
    hierarchy without passing the props down manually to each level.

    What do you mean by Prop Drilling ?
->  Prop Drilling means Passing data through several nested children components in order 
    to deliver the data to the deeply nested Components.    

    What do you mean useContext ?
->  The React useContext provides data to components no matter how deep they are in the 
    components tree. The useContext is used to manage global data.   

    what do you mean by ContextAPI ?
->  The Context API is a React structure that enables you to exchange data to several 
    component without passing the props down manually to each level.
    It is Consisting of Providers and Consumers.    

    What do you mean by useParams?
->  useParams returns an object of key/value pairs of url parameters.

    What do you mean by useLocation ?
->  useLocation hook returns the location object used by the react-router-dom.

    What do you mean by useMemo ?
->  React useMemo Hook returns a  memoized Value.
    The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its Dependencies Update.  

    The useMemo Hook can be used to avoid expensive resource, intensive functions from 
    needlessly running.
    The useMemo Hook to memorize the expensiveCalculation function. This will cause the function
    to only run when needed.
    The useMemoHook accepts a second parameter to declare dependencies. The expensive function
    will only run when its dependencies have changed.

    What do you Mean by useRef ?
->  UseRef Hook is used to persist values between Renders.
    It can be used to access a HTML DOM elements directly.
    When we use ref as Attribute in any HTML element then specified value provided to ref will 
    access to all of the properties of that HTML element.

    useRef() only returns one item. It returns an Object called current.
    When we initialize useRef we set the initial value: useRef(0).

     What do you mean by Pure Component in React ?
->  A React Component is said to be Pure if it renders the same output for the same State and 
    Props.

    What do you mean by useCallback ?
->  useCallback hooks returns a memoized callback function. 
    useCallback hooks only runs when one of its dependencies update. 
    The useCallback and useMemo Hooks are similar. The main difference is that useMemo returns
    a memoized value and useCallback returns a memorised function.
    
    What do you mean by useReducer ?
->  UseReducer is similar to useState Hook.
    It is used for Custom Logic.
    if we have keep track of multiple states in big Projects that rely on Complex Logic.

    UseReducer hook takes two arguments reducer function and intial state.
    UseReducer hook returns the state and a dispatch method.

    What do you mean by UseHistory?
->  useHistory hook allows us to access React Router's DOM history object.

    What do you mean by Redux in react?
->  Redux is a Pattern or libaray for managing and updating the application state using events
    called actions.It serves as a centeralized store for state that needs to be used across
    our entire application.

    What do you mean By Actions?
->  Actions are Plain JavaScript Objects that have a type field actions that only tell what to do
    ,but they don't tell how to do it. 

    What do you mean by Reducers?
->  Reducers are functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return
    a new state result.

    What do you mean by Store?
->  A store is a state container which holds the application's state.
    Every Redux store has a single root reducer function.

Notes- The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action.
       The global state of our application is stored as an object inside a single store.

    What do you mean by Jest?
->  Jest is a free open source test framework created by facebook that has a great integration
    with React.js.
    It was primarily designed for React based apps but could be used to write automation
    scenarios for any Javascript Based Codebases.

    What do you mean by Enzyme ?
->  Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React
    Components' output. we can also manipulate, traverse, and in some ways simulate runtime
    given the output.    

    What do you mean by Redux Thunk ?
->  Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead 
    of an action.
