   What do you mean by Springboot ?
-> Springboot is a Module of a Spring from which we speed up the development process.
   
   Springboot makes it easy to create standalone production-grade spring based Applications
   that we can just run with the jar file.

   Springboot = Spring FrameWork + Embedded Servers - Configuration


   What are the differences between Spring and Springboot ?
->              Spring                        |                    Springboot

  1. Widely used for building enterprise         1.  Widely used for building REST APIs.
     Java applications.

  2. Involves writing lots of boilerplate code.  2. It Reduces boilerplate code.

  3. Configuration is not auto.                  3. Configuration is auto.
     we have to write Configuration in 
     xml or using Annoatation.

  4. It Involves setting up server manually.     4. It Includes embedded server like Tomcat 
                                                    and Jetty.

  5. Needs dependencies to be defined manually.  5. Starters take care of dependencies.  

  
  
  Note - 
  Springboot scans the classpath and find the dependency it will automatically configure 
  the things.


  Advantages of Springboot        

  1. It Creates StandAlone Spring applications that can be started using Java jar.
  2. Tomcat , Jetty are the Embedded Servers provided with Springboot.
  3. Provide Opinionated Starter dependencies to simplify your build Configuration.
  4. Automatic Configure Spring and 3rd Party Libaries.
  5. No requirement of XML Configuration.


  Ways to Start With the Springboot Project Development

  1. Create a Maven Project and Add Starter Dependencies.
  2. Use Spring Intializr
  3. Use IDEs like STS 
  4. Springboot Command line Interface. 

  
    What is the Use of Application Properties File in Springboot ?
->  It is a File used to keep 'N' number of properties in a single file to run the application
    in a different environment.  

    What do you mean by JPA in Springboot ?
->  JPA Stands for Java Persistence API. It is a Specification for Object Relational mapping
    in Java.    
    It is Implemented by Different ORM Frameworks. ORM like Hibernate Implements JPA for 
    Performing Operations with Database.

    What do you mean by Custom Finders methods ?
->  Custom Finder Methods in Springboot is used for Dynamic queries and custom SQL Queries.

   Supported Queries in SQL

   1.  And   -> findByLastnameAndFirstname  ->    where x.firstname =?1 and x.lastname =?2
   2.  Or    -> findByLastnameOrFirstName   ->    where x.firstname =?1 or x.lastname =?2
   3.  Is, Equals  ->     findByFirstname , findByFirstnameIs ,findByFirstnameEquals  ->
       where x.firstname =? 1
   4.  Between ->  findByStartDateBetween  ->     where x.startDate between ?1 and ?2
   5.  LessThan  ->  findByAgeLessThan  -         where x.age <? 1
   6.  GreaterThan ->  findByAgeGreaterThan ->    where x.age >? 1
   7.  LessThanEqual -> findByAgeLessThanEquals  ->  where x.age <=? 1
   8.  GreaterThanEquals -> findByAgeGreaterThanEquals  -> where x.age >=? 1
   9.  IsNull,Null    -> findByAge(Is)Null    ->   where x.age is Null
   10. IsNotNull,NotNull  -> findByAge(Is)NotNull  -> where  x.age is not Null
   11. StartingWith  ->    findByFirstnameStartingWith -> where x.firstname like ?1 (Parameter
       Bound with apppended %)
   12. EndingWith  - findByFirstnameEndingWith  ->   where x.firstname like ?1 (Parameter 
       Preponed with %)   

   What do you mean by JPSQL ?
-> The Java Persistence query language (JPQL) is used to define queries against persistent
   entities independent of the mechanism used to store those entities.   

   JPQL allows you to express the queries in terms of the Java entities rather than the
   (native) SQL tables and columns.

   What do you mean by Native SQL Queries ?
-> Native SQL Queries Refers to the Actual SQL Queries.
   These queries are the SQL statements which can be directly executed in database using a 
   database client.   

   What do you mean By REST APIS ?
-> REST stands for representational state transfer used to for Transfering Data over Web. 
   
   A REST API is a way for two Computer Systems to Communicate Over HTTP in a similar way
   to Web browers and Servers.
   The primary goal of API is to standardize data exchange between web services.

   The Important HTTP Verbs -
   GET  - It Reads a Resource.
   PUT - It Updates an Existing Resource.
   POST - It Creates a new Resource.
   DELTE - It Deletes a Resource.
  
   Standard Status Code - 

   404 - Resource Not Found
   200 - Success
   201 - created
   401 - UnAuthorized
   500 - Server Error

   What do you mean by Spring DevTools ?
-> DevTools Stands for Developer Tool. SpringBoot DevTools Picks Up The Server Changes and
