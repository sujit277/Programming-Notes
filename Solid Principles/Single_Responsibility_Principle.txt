                       Single Responsibility Principles
                       --------------------------------

Here In the Below Example we have IUser Class Which is Related to the User,But as you 
can See Login and Register Methods are Related to the User But LogError and SendEmail Methods
Not Related to the User. 

class IUser{

    bool Login(String Username,String Password){
        Logic
    }

    bool Register(String Username,String Password,String Email){
        Logic
    }

    void LogError(String Error){
        Logic
    }

    bool SendEmail(String EmailContent){
        Logic
    }
}


As Single Responsibility Principles We have Splited the Above Class Methods into Three
Different Classes with Each Class Having Single Purposes.

class IUser{
    
    bool Login(String Username,String Password){
        Logic
    }

    bool Register(String Username,String Password,String Email){
        Logic
    }   
}

class ILogger{

    void LogError(String Error){
        Logic
    }
}

class IEmail{

    bool SendEmail(String EmailContent){
        Logic
    }
}
